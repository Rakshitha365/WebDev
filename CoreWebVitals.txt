Core Web Vitals are a set of metrics introduced by Google to measure and improve the user experience on websites. They focus on key aspects of performance, interactivity, and visual stability. These metrics are critical for search engine optimization (SEO) and contribute to Google's page ranking algorithm.




1. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
What It Measures: The time it takes for the largest visible content (e.g., an image or block of text) to load and render on the screen.
Good Threshold: Less than 2.5 seconds.
Impact on UX: Directly reflects how fast users perceive the page to load.
Improvement Tips:
Optimize server response times.
Use efficient image formats and compression.
Use a content delivery network (CDN).
Minimize render-blocking resources (CSS/JS).





2. First Input Delay (FID)
What It Measures: The time between a user's first interaction (e.g., clicking a link or button) and the browser's response.
Good Threshold: Less than 100 milliseconds.
Impact on UX: Ensures the page is interactive and responsive.
Improvement Tips:
Minimize JavaScript execution time.
Break long tasks into smaller chunks.
Use lazy loading for non-critical resources.





3. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
What It Measures: The visual stability of a page by tracking unexpected layout shifts during the page load.
Good Threshold: Less than 0.1.
Impact on UX: Prevents user frustration caused by elements unexpectedly moving (e.g., buttons shifting position).
Improvement Tips:
Specify dimensions for images and videos.
Reserve space for ads and dynamically injected content.
Avoid using animations that trigger layout shifts.

Optimization Checklist:

1. Performance Optimization
    i. Use lazy loading for images and iframes.
    ii. Optimize and compress images (e.g., WebP format).
    iii. Enable browser caching and HTTP/2.

2. Interactivity
    i. Split long-running JavaScript tasks.
    ii. Defer non-critical scripts.

3. Stability
    i. Use fixed dimensions for images and ads.
    ii. Avoid inserting content above existing content dynamically.
